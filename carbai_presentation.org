* Premise
- Computation of carbon emissions for companies is expensive and
  discourages them from not only calculating it but acting on the
  information the results provide
- Environmental agencies restrict access to emission data behind
  paywall and licensing issues, creating barriers for those looking to
  gain insight and help the industry

* Concept
- Deliver AI backed analytics to businesses of any size to improve their
  carbon footprint
- Utilize external data in addition to creating new data from client
  base to improve predictions and recommendations
