* Premise
- Calculating carbon emissions is expensive and time-consuming, a
  headache for large companies and a nightmare for smaller ones
- Environmental agencies restrict access to emission data behind
  paywalls and licensing agreements, creating barriers for those
  looking to learn about and reduce their carbon footprint

** 
Data is difficult to procure across multiple companies and industries,
making accountability difficult as relative comparisons are hard to
make
** 
Companies generally only report their final tonnage of Scope 1, 2, and
3 emissions. Such data, which lack the inclusion of the calculating
variables used in the EPAs reporting guidelines, only give a vague
idea of the factors that affect emissions and what may be done about
them
* Concept
- Deliver AI backed analytics to businesses of any size to improve their
  carbon footprint
- Utilize external data in addition to creating new data from clients
  and users to improve predictions and recommendations
- Share knowledge base to help inform consumer decisions, hold
  industry accountable and move towards a healthier planet
** 
- Publicly and for-sale data will be aggregated to let businesses
  and consumers better evaluate and judge the companies they interact with
- Trained web-scrappers help find company specific data, folding it
  into averages for industry and region, along with the company's own
  portfolio
** 
- CARB・AI will expand its initial models over time using new data and
  input. Such models will be continually evaluated against the existing
  scientific literature to either further support or potentialy
  improve existing methods of estimating carbon emissions
